            <p>
              I love to problem solve. <br> 
              At an early age I noticed how much I enjoyed math and the complexity of advanced math. 
              As I began to learn new methods of math, such as multiplication and division, 
              math became my favorite subject and I wanted to learn efficiant ways to handle math problems. 
              During high school I became interested in learning more about computers and how they worked. 
              I tried a maintenance class that taught me how to build my first computer and then quickly found out
              I cared more about what the computer could do once it was on and less about how to build it. 
              Always facinated by coding, I thought it would be too difficult to learn and never 
              decided to pursue a career in it. <br> <br>
              Needing a job to start a career I thought that I could work in a refinary like the rest of my family. 
              After 2 years of working in that field I relized I wanted something different, something that was new and 
              a little challenging. During covid, I wanted to learn something new so I became a leasing agent and noticed
              that I really liked to talk to customers and try to advacate for them. 
              After a year of leasing, the management saw potential in me and promoted me to assistant property manager.
              In this new role I found more challenges that I welcomed. I learned to communicate with clients and
              and contractors more efficiantlly, I became more efficiant with computers learning to type faster and 
              troubleshoot a whole new system. <br><br>
              I continued at for 2 years and noticed I was no longer growning
              in my skills and the challenges were fading. During the 2 years I had gotten married and wanted to try
              and find a career to support my new wife. Having a background in Ultrasonic testing, I wanted to try and 
              make that my full career. I knew the money would be good and I was sure to find new challenges.
              New challenges was an understatement, I was able to pick up the information needed for this new job pretty
              quick. However the main challenge was that I would be traveling around the world to job sites. Newly
              married I wasn't that excited about this, but I made the most of it and tried to advance my career into more 
              advanced testing. <br> <br>
              A little less than a year later, I found it extreamly hard to leave my wife for weeks at a time constantly.
              After long consideration, we decided it would be best for me to leave ultrasonic testing behind me. With little
              to no idea where to go from there, I had a friend who tried to get me into coding years ago and I struggled to think
              I could do it. He encourged me to try Codecademy, saying it was a good website to get a foundation started.
              One month into learning code, I began to realize that this could be something I do for a career. Endless challenges,
              building projects from scratch, and language after language, it felt like there would be a new challenge 
              everyday. <br><br>
              Learning so much in a short time, I began building my first project followed by a portfolio to show off the 
              project. I wanted to start with something familiar and a calculator was a project that many people recommended
              for early programmers. It gave me much needed confidence after finishing my first project, something I once 
              thought would be too difficult now something I would be lucky to do for the rest of my life.
